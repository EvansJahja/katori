# Project Structure

## Overview
Katori is organized as a Rust workspace with separate packages for different concerns:

```
katori/
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml          # Workspace root configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ src/main.rs         # Main application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ katori-gui/         # GUI package using egui
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/lib.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ gdbadapter/         # GDB communication package
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ src/lib.rs
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Packages

### katori (root)
- Main binary that orchestrates the GUI and GDB adapter
- Minimal entry point that initializes both components

### katori-gui
- GUI implementation using egui framework
- Creates standalone desktop application (no browser required)
- Handles user interface and user interactions

### gdbadapter
- Handles communication with GDB using GDB/MI protocol
- Can be extracted as a standalone crate later
- Provides high-level API for debugging operations

## Running the Application

```bash
cargo run
```

This will compile and launch the standalone desktop application.

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Creates optimized executable in `target/release/katori.exe`

## Features

- âœ… Standalone desktop application (no browser/web dependencies)
- âœ… Modern Rust GUI using egui
- âœ… Modular architecture for easy extraction of components
- ðŸš§ GDB integration (planned)
- ðŸš§ Debugging interface (planned)
