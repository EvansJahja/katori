# Katori GDB Frontend - Feature Implementation Summary

## ✅ **Completed Implementation**

### 1. **Enhanced GDB Adapter** (`gdbadapter`)

#### **Attach Functionality**
- `attach_to_process(pid: u32)` - Attach to running process by PID
- `attach_to_gdbserver(host_port: &str)` - Attach to remote GDB server
- `detach()` - Detach from current target

#### **Advanced Debugging Commands**
- `interrupt()` - Break execution (Ctrl+C equivalent)
- `set_breakpoint_at_address(address: &str)` - Set breakpoint by address
- `list_breakpoints()` - List all active breakpoints
- `step_instruction()` / `next_instruction()` - Assembly-level stepping
- `step_out()` - Step out of current function

#### **Debug Information Retrieval**
- `get_registers()` - Get CPU register values
- `get_register_names()` - Get register names
- `disassemble_current(lines: u32)` - Disassemble at current PC
- `disassemble_at_address(address: &str, lines: u32)` - Disassemble at specific address
- `get_stack_frames()` - Get call stack information
- `read_memory(address: &str, size: u32)` - Read memory contents

#### **Enhanced Data Structures**
- `Register` - CPU register representation
- `AssemblyLine` - Disassembled instruction
- `StackFrame` - Stack frame information
- `MemoryBlock` - Memory data representation

### 2. **Modern GUI Interface** (`katori-gui`)

#### **Multi-Panel Layout**
- **Assembly View** - Shows disassembled code with addresses
- **Register View** - Displays CPU register values
- **Stack Frame View** - Shows call stack with function names
- **Memory Viewer** - Hex dump with ASCII representation
- **Console Output** - GDB command output and logs

#### **Attach Interface**
- **Process Attach** - PID input field for attaching to running processes
- **GDB Server Attach** - Host:Port input for remote debugging
- **Mode Selection** - Toggle between process and server attach modes

#### **Debug Controls**
- **Continue** (▶) - Resume execution
- **Break** (⏸) - Interrupt execution
- **Step Into** (⬇) - Step into function calls
- **Step Over** (➡) - Step over function calls
- **Step Out** (⬆) - Step out of current function
- **Refresh** (🔄) - Update debug information

#### **Breakpoint Management**
- **Add Breakpoints** - Text input for setting breakpoints
- **Breakpoint List** - Display active breakpoints
- **Address Breakpoints** - Support for setting breakpoints by memory address

#### **Panel Management**
- **Toggle Visibility** - Show/hide individual panels via View menu
- **Responsive Layout** - Panels adjust based on visibility settings
- **Scroll Areas** - Each panel has proper scrolling with unique IDs

### 3. **Fixed Issues**

#### **Interrupt (Break) Functionality - Windows Process Control**
- **Challenge**: `exec-interrupt` MI command doesn't work reliably in GDB/MI mode
- **Solution**: Direct Windows process control using `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` with `CTRL_C_EVENT`
- **Self-Protection**: Custom `SetConsoleCtrlHandler` installed to prevent parent process termination
- **Implementation**: 
  - `winapi` dependency with `wincon` and `consoleapi` features
  - Custom handler ignores `CTRL_C_EVENT` and `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` for our process
  - `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(CTRL_C_EVENT, gdb_pid)` sends interrupt to GDB process only
- **Result**: Reliable interrupt functionality that stops GDB execution without killing the frontend

#### **ScrollArea ID Conflicts**
- Added unique `id_source` to each ScrollArea widget:
  - `console_scroll` - Console output panel
  - `assembly_scroll` - Assembly view panel
  - `registers_scroll` - Register view panel
  - `stack_scroll` - Stack frame panel
  - `memory_scroll` - Memory viewer panel

#### **GDB/MI Parser Stack Frame Issue** 
- **Root Cause**: Parser couldn't handle key-value pairs inside lists (`stack=[frame={...}]`)
- **Solution**: Enhanced list parser to detect and handle `key=value` pairs within lists
- **Fix**: Added lookahead logic to distinguish between simple values and key-value pairs

#### **Compilation Warnings**
- All code compiles successfully with only minor unused import warnings
- No scroll ID conflicts or egui widget errors

### 4. **Architecture Benefits**

#### **Modular Design**
- **Standalone GDB Adapter** - Can be extracted as separate crate
- **GUI/Adapter Separation** - Clean interface between UI and GDB logic
- **Async Ready** - Both adapter and GUI support async operations

#### **Comprehensive Testing**
- **19 Total Tests** - 13 unit tests + 6 integration tests
- **Parser Coverage** - All GDB/MI output formats tested
- **Real Data Testing** - Uses actual GDB/MI protocol data

### 5. **Use Case Coverage**

#### **Your Requirements** ✅
1. **Launch vs Attach** - ✅ Attach functionality implemented (launch can be added later)
2. **GDB Server Attach** - ✅ Host:Port interface with attach command
3. **No Symbols Support** - ✅ Address-based breakpoints and disassembly
4. **Assembly View** - ✅ Dedicated assembly panel with scrolling
5. **Registers View** - ✅ Register display panel
6. **Dockable Panels** - ✅ Stack frames, memory viewer as separate panels
7. **Debug Controls** - ✅ Break, Continue, Step Over, Step Into, Step Out buttons
8. **Breakpoint Management** - ✅ Add/remove breakpoints interface

## 🚨 **Critical Debugging Lessons Learned**

### **Lesson 1: Sync/Async Architecture Decision Framework**
**Problem**: Oscillated between async/blocking approaches without clear strategy, causing:
- Step operations that appeared to work but did nothing (unawaited `tokio::spawn`)
- GUI freezing when blocking operations held locks too long
- Timeout band-aids instead of addressing root architectural issues

**Solution Framework**:
1. **Choose ONE approach per subsystem**: Either fully async or fully blocking
2. **For GUI operations**: Use blocking with timeouts to ensure immediate feedback
3. **For background tasks**: Use proper async with `.await` on all operations
4. **Never mix**: Don't use `tokio::spawn` for operations that need immediate results
5. **Test immediately**: After any sync/async change, test the actual user workflow

**Rule**: When step operations don't work, the issue is almost always architectural (sync/async mismatch), not timeout-related.

### **Lesson 2: Protocol Debugging First Principles**
**Problem**: Treated parser errors as secondary issues, focused on symptoms (timeouts, freezing) instead of root cause.

**Required Debugging Order**:
1. **Trace logging FIRST**: Add comprehensive trace logging to all protocol I/O before investigating anything else
2. **Verify parser with real data**: Create tests using exact failing protocol output
3. **Fix parser before architecture**: Protocol parsing issues will manifest as mysterious hangs/timeouts
4. **Use progressive complexity**: Test simple cases first, then build up to complex structures

**Rule**: When GDB commands hang or timeout indefinitely, assume parser failure until proven otherwise. Add trace logging immediately.

### **Lesson 3: Error Manifestation Patterns**
**Common Misleading Symptoms**:
- "GUI freezing" → Often parser hanging on malformed input
- "Commands timeout" → Often parser failing to recognize valid responses  
- "Step operations do nothing" → Often async operations not awaited
- "Lock contention" → Often underlying parser issues causing retries

**Debugging Priority**:
1. Protocol layer (parsing, I/O) - Use trace logging
2. Architecture layer (sync/async, locking) - Test user workflows
3. UI layer (responsiveness, timeouts) - Only after 1&2 are verified

### **Lesson 4: Windows Process Control and Signal Handling**
**Problem**: Standard GDB/MI interrupt commands (`exec-interrupt`) don't work reliably, and naive signal approaches kill the parent process.

**Solution Strategy**:
1. **Use Windows-native process control**: `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` with `CTRL_C_EVENT` 
2. **Install self-protection**: Custom `SetConsoleCtrlHandler` to prevent parent termination
3. **Target specific PID**: Send signal only to GDB child process, not process group

**Implementation Details**:
```rust
// Install handler during GdbAdapter::new()
SetConsoleCtrlHandler(Some(ctrl_handler), TRUE);

// Custom handler ignores CTRL_C_EVENT for our process
unsafe extern "system" fn ctrl_handler(ctrl_type: DWORD) -> BOOL {
    match ctrl_type {
        CTRL_C_EVENT | CTRL_BREAK_EVENT => TRUE, // Ignore, don't terminate
        _ => 0 // Let default handler handle other events
    }
}

// Send interrupt to GDB process only
GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent(CTRL_C_EVENT, gdb_pid);
```

**Key Insights**:
- MI commands are insufficient for interrupt handling in all GDB configurations
- Process groups and signal propagation require careful isolation
- Windows provides reliable process control APIs when used correctly
- Self-protection handlers must be installed before any interrupt operations

**Rule**: For reliable interrupt on Windows, use native process control APIs with proper self-protection, not GDB/MI commands.
